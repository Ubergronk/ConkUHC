Hello! Welcome to ConkUHC. This is a datapack for Minecraft 1.20.4 that reimagines the traditional UHC format with custom recipes, shrinking borders, and mechanical adjustments to vanilla.

# INSTALLATION
The datapack can be installed simply by dragging the .zip file into the "WORLDNAME/datapacks" folder. The datapack only needs to be installed by the server host.

# RESOURCE PACK INSTALLATION
The resource pack can be installed to the world itself, the server, or on each client. The resource pack is not required for the functionality of the datapack, but it is strongly recommended.
